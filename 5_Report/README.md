# Abstract

# INTRODUCTION
Hygiene is an important aspect to remain healthy. There are various
aspects of hygiene. A clean hand is one of them. Hands generally
are touched at various surfaces and can be exposed to direct
contamination. Cleaning hands at regular interval is recommended by
various health organizations including WHO.
Hand hygiene is now regarded as one of the most important element
of infection control activities. In the wake of the growing burden
of health care associated infections (HCAIs), the increasing
severity of illness and complexity of treatment, superimposed by
multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogen infections, health care
practitioners (HCPs) are reversing back to the basics of infection
preventions by simple measures like hand hygiene. This is because
enough scientific evidence supports the observation that if
properly implemented, hand hygiene alone can significantly reduce
the risk of cross-transmission of infection in healthcare
facilities (HCFs)1-5.
