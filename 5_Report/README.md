# ABSTRACT
COVID pandemic has influenced human life in various sectors. Various attempts were made to reduce the virus transferring by work from home, social distancing, and also including hand hygiene. As COVID-19 are transferrable through touch and contact, there are WHO guidelines to clean or sanitize hands regularly to reduce the risk of infection. Dispensing of sanitizer from bottle and storage would require manual intervention. And so far, most of the available hand sanitizers do not operate automatically. This article aims to make an automatic hand sanitizer which finds it's use in hospitals, work places, offices, schools and much more to reduce the risk due to contact. Here, the system can sense the proximity with the help of ultrasonic sensor and sends signal to microcontroller. The controller processes the sensor data & actuates the pump and solenoid valve. And the result is the sanitizer liquid dispenses through mist nozzle.

# INTRODUCTION
Hygiene is an important aspect to remain healthy. There are various
aspects of hygiene. A clean hand is one of them. Hands generally
are touched at various surfaces and can be exposed to direct
contamination. Cleaning hands at regular interval is recommended by
various health organizations including WHO.
Hand hygiene is now regarded as one of the most important element
of infection control activities. In the wake of the growing burden
of health care associated infections (HCAIs), the increasing
severity of illness and complexity of treatment, superimposed by
multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogen infections, health care
practitioners (HCPs) are reversing back to the basics of infection
preventions by simple measures like hand hygiene. This is because
enough scientific evidence supports the observation that if
properly implemented, hand hygiene alone can significantly reduce
the risk of cross-transmission of infection in healthcare
facilities (HCFs)1-5.
