COVID pandemic has influenced human life in various sectors.
Various attempts were made to reduce the virus transferring by work
from home, social distancing, and also including hand hygiene. As
COVID-19 are transferrable through touch and contact, there are WHO
guidelines to clean or sanitize hands regularly to reduce the risk
of infection. Dispensing of sanitizer from bottle and storage would
require manual intervention. And so far, most of the available hand
sanitizers do not operate automatically. This article aims to make
an automatic hand sanitizer which finds it's use in hospitals, work
places, offices, schools and much more to reduce the risk due to
contact. Here, the system can sense the proximity with the help of
ultrasonic sensor and sends signal to microcontroller. The controller processes the sensor data & actuates the pump
and solenoid valve. And the result is the sanitizer liquid
dispenses through mist nozzle.
